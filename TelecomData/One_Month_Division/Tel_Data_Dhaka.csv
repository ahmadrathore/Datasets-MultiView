1.1,Can we experiment by node level?,,,,,,

Prposed,,,,,Purpose: will more data give better accuracy results,,

3,Based on the Purchase capacity,,,Our nodes can be seggregated by Service Type. See effect of Bandwith distribution on Capacity Distribution comparison with ,,,

4,Business logic and methametical proof of saving time and optimized decision making.,,,,,,
,Curren15 Days,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,we are taking decision based on Predictive Data. The benfeit is is we can take decision 15 days ahead and take decision about the purchase capacity,,,,,,
,How much % of time of decision making making. Be prepared for any disaster or issues. Increase the statisfaction of user.,,,,,,
